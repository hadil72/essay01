			<h2>BETWEEN INTROVERSION AND EXTRAVERSION</h2>
			<p>Reflecting on my past, I remember being quite the talkative child. I enjoyed interacting with others. I used to be shy at times, but mostly I liked to play and socialize. Even at school, it was never a challenge to find my social circle, seamlessly blending into conversations or quietly absorbing the chatter of others.

			As the years went by, I encountered the notions of introversion and extraversion, prompting a reevaluation of my social preferences. I found myself gravitating towards moments of solitude, relishing the opportunity to recharge and reflect. Understanding the fluidity of personality traits, I embraced the idea that individuals exist along a spectrum, free from categorical constraints.

			<h2>INTROVERSION</h2>
			<p>An introvert is a person with qualities of a personality type known as introversion, which means that they feel more comfortable focusing on their inner thoughts and ideas, rather than whatâ€™s happening externally. They enjoy spending time with just one or two people, rather than large groups or crowds. </p>

			<h2>EXTRAVERSION</h2>
			<p>The term extroversion describes an aspect of a personality that is often characterized by expressive and outgoing patterns of behavior. People who are extroverts tend to be very talkative, sociable, active, and warm. Jung defined an extrovert as someone who feels energized by the external world and social interactions.</p>

			<h2>INTROVERT VS. EXTROVERT</h2>
			<p>When I found out that there this two concepts of personality trait, I tried to find out which of this is my trait. But I neither felt too introverted nor too extroverted and the people around always put me in a different category, so it became super confusing to me. Sometimes I needed to be the extrovert in the group as the others were to introverted, but sometimes I became the introvert when someone else takes the role of the extrovert. Thank god, I found out that something like the ambivert existed.</p>

			<h2>AMBIVERT</h2>
			<p>An ambivert is someone who exhibits both extroverted and introverted tendencies, falling somewhere in between the two extremes on the personality spectrum. Ambiverts can be social and outgoing in certain situations, but also enjoy solitude and introspection at other times. They may adapt their behavior depending on the context or their mood, making them flexible in various social settings.</p>
